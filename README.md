# SyncEd  
*Accessible Learning, Anywhere – Even Offline*

## About the Platform  
SyncEd is an online-first learning platform with **selective offline capabilities**, designed to make education accessible for students in rural, remote, and low-connectivity areas.  
Students can **choose** to download lessons and quizzes for offline use, complete them without internet access, and have their progress **automatically synced** to a central database once reconnected.  
The platform is **device-agnostic**, allowing users to log in from any computer or mobile device and continue exactly where they left off.

## Problem  
In Canada, many rural and Indigenous communities face **limited connectivity**, making it difficult for students to fully participate in digital learning.  
Existing online platforms assume constant internet access, while fully offline solutions are often **storage-heavy** and lack flexibility.  
This creates a gap in **accessible, scalable, and storage-friendly** learning tools.

---

## Solution  
SyncEd bridges this gap by:
- **Online-first design** with optional offline access.  
- **Selective content downloads** to conserve storage.  
- **Auto-sync** of offline progress when internet returns.  
- **User account portability** – start on one device, continue on another.  
- **Lightweight modular content** for bandwidth efficiency.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Selective Offline Mode** – Download/delete lessons and quizzes at will.  
- **Cross-Device Sync** – Progress follows the user, not the device.  
- **Low-Storage Friendly** – Small, modular lesson packs instead of large bulk downloads.  
- **Teacher Dashboard** *(planned)* – View student progress, analytics, and assign work.  
- **Curriculum-Ready** – Designed for easy integration with Canadian K–12 and adult education programs.  

---

## Impact  
- **Educational Equity:** Supports learners in low-connectivity and underserved regions.  
- **Scalability:** Works for K–12, higher education, vocational training, and adult learning.  
- **Flexibility:** Compatible with existing infrastructure; no special hardware needed.  

---

## Why It’s Different  
Unlike existing LMS platforms:
- **Not fully offline by default** – users control storage usage.  
- **Not always-online only** – works in poor connectivity areas.  
- **Designed for Canada’s rural & Indigenous education needs** from the ground up.

## Future Development  
- Secure exam mode with integrity checks.  
- AI-assisted lesson recommendations.  
- Full integration with provincial learning management systems.
