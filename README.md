# SyncEd  
Accessible Learning, Anywhere – Even Offline

## Overview of the Platform
SyncEd is an online-first learning platform with selective offline capabilities, designed to make education accessible for students in rural, remote, and low-connectivity areas. Students can choose to download lessons and quizzes for offline use, complete them without internet access, and have their progress automatically synced to a central database once reconnected. The platform is device-agnostic, allowing users to log in from any computer or mobile device and continue exactly where they left off.

## Problem  
In Canada, many rural and Indigenous communities face limited connectivity, making it difficult for students to fully participate in digital learning. Existing online platforms assume constant internet access, while fully offline solutions are often storage-heavy and lack flexibility. This creates a gap in accessible, scalable, and storage-friendly learning tools.

## Solution  
SyncEd bridges this gap by offering an online-first design with optional offline access, selective content downloads to conserve storage, automatic syncing of offline progress when internet returns, user account portability to start on one device and continue on another, and lightweight modular content for bandwidth efficiency.

## Impact  
SyncEd empowers learners in low-connectivity and underserved regions to participate fully in digital education without the constraints of continuous internet access or high storage requirements. Unlike existing LMS platforms that are either fully offline by default or entirely online-only, SyncEd is designed for flexibility—users control what they download and when, ensuring efficient use of both device storage and bandwidth. This selective offline approach, combined with cross-device progress syncing, makes it uniquely suited for Canada’s rural and Indigenous education needs. The platform’s architecture is built from the ground up to accommodate intermittent connectivity, providing an experience that existing solutions would struggle to retrofit into their systems.
